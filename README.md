# TERMiGUi
Welcome to my terrible software
this is just a little program to make terminal based applications with a gui and allow a developer to have a nicer user interface to do simple tasks
you can use compile_and_execute.bat to just have an hangman example but you can do anything a terminal based app can besides showing colors cos i suck
if for some reason your using this you should stop and learn tkinter library instead.

But if you're from some reason still here,heres a tutorial on how to get a working EXE that you can share or whatever
1. Edit the compile_and_execute.bat to make sure theres no issues with new files that you introduced
2. install the msixbundle to have winget installed
3. run the compile_and_execute.bat

if you wanna share this crap around for some reason the exe is in dist\code.exe if you didnt change it or whatever
